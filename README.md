# Advent of code 2023

My attempts at [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) 2023.

I hope to use only the Python standard library (plus `pytest` as the test runner).

## Setting up

Use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to set the version of Python:

```
pyenv install
```

Then set up a virtual environment, switch to it and install dependencies:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
